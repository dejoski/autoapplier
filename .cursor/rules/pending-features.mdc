# Pending Feature Implementation Guide

This project has several UI components and features that have been designed but require functional implementation (e.g., button actions, form submissions, linking to actual content or pages).

A detailed checklist of all pending features and their corresponding components is maintained in [TODO_FEATURES.md](mdc:TODO_FEATURES.md).

Key components with pending functionalities include:

-   **Header**: Navigation and project dropdown links in [src/components/layout/header.tsx](mdc:src/components/layout/header.tsx)
-   **Footer**: Navigation and project links in [src/components/layout/footer.tsx](mdc:src/components/layout/footer.tsx)
-   **Hero Section**: Call-to-action buttons (Get In Touch, Download CV) and social links in [src/components/sections/hero-section.tsx](mdc:src/components/sections/hero-section.tsx)
-   **Projects Section**: Live demo and GitHub links for each project in [src/components/sections/projects-section.tsx](mdc:src/components/sections/projects-section.tsx)
-   **Contact Section**: Form submission logic in [src/components/sections/contact-section.tsx](mdc:src/components/sections/contact-section.tsx)

Always refer to [TODO_FEATURES.md](mdc:TODO_FEATURES.md) for the most up-to-date list of pending tasks before working on new features or refactoring existing ones.
